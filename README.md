- `GET /api/health` - System status for monitoring

**Setup & Configuration:**
- `GET /setup` - Guided setup wizard
- `POST /api/create-key` - Generate API keys for integrations
- `GET /admin/dashboard` - System administration

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Business Setup & Troubleshooting**

### üîÑ **Common Business Scenarios**

#### **"Payments aren't syncing to my accounting system"**
1. **Check** `/health` - Is Stripe/Xero connection green?
2. **Verify** API keys are correct in setup wizard
3. **Test** with a small payment to confirm sync
4. **Timeline**: Usually fixes within 5 minutes

#### **"I can't see my customer data"**
1. **Confirm** Xero OAuth connection is active
2. **Check** you have customer read permissions in Xero
3. **Refresh** the page - data syncs every 30 seconds
4. **Alternative**: Re-run setup wizard to refresh connections

#### **"The system shows as 'unhealthy'"**
1. **Visit** `/health` to see specific issue
2. **Common fixes**:
   - Expired OAuth tokens ‚Üí Re-authenticate
   - Network connectivity ‚Üí Check internet connection
   - API rate limits ‚Üí Wait 1-2 minutes
3. **When to worry**: Only if issues persist >15 minutes

### üîí **Security Best Practices for Business**

#### **What We Handle Automatically:**
- ‚úÖ **Encrypted storage** of all API keys and credentials
- ‚úÖ **Secure connections** (HTTPS) to all financial services
- ‚úÖ **Automatic session management** - no password sharing needed
- ‚úÖ **Audit logging** - track who accessed what and when

#### **What You Should Do:**
- üîë **Use strong passwords** for your Stripe/Xero accounts
- üö´ **Don't share** the server URL outside your organization
- üîÑ **Regular backups** of your financial data (in Xero/Stripe)
- üìû **Monitor access** - check `/admin/dashboard` monthly

### üöë **Getting Help Fast**

**For Immediate Issues:**
1. **Check** `/health` dashboard first
2. **Try** refreshing your browser
3. **Restart** the application if needed

**For Setup Questions:**
- The setup wizard guides you through everything
- Most connections work in under 5 minutes
- Demo mode available if you want to explore first

### üíæ **Windows Launcher Troubleshooting**

#### **"Financial-Command-Center-AI.cmd won't start"**
1. **Check Python installation**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
2. **Run as administrator**: Right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator"
3. **Check virtual environment**: The script creates `.venv` automatically
4. **Internet connection**: Required for downloading dependencies

#### **"Desktop shortcut not working"**
1. **Manual shortcut creation**: Run `Create-Desktop-Shortcut.cmd`
2. **Check target path**: Shortcut should point to `Quick-Start-Flask.cmd`
3. **Permissions issue**: Run shortcut creation as administrator
4. **Missing files**: Ensure `Quick-Start-Flask.cmd` exists in directory

#### **"Server not starting on https://127.0.0.1:8000"**
1. **Port conflict**: Check if port 8000 is already in use
2. **SSL certificate issues**: Run `Test-Quick-Launch.cmd` for diagnosis
3. **Virtual environment**: Delete `.venv` folder and run launcher again
4. **Firewall blocking**: Allow Python through Windows Firewall

#### **"PowerShell execution policy error"**
1. **Open PowerShell as administrator**
2. **Run**: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
3. **Alternative**: Use batch scripts instead of PowerShell versions

#### **"Browser shows 'connection not secure' warning"**
1. **Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to 127.0.0.1 (unsafe)"** - this is normal for self-signed certificates
2. **Install certificate**: Check `/admin/ssl-help` for certificate installation
3. **Use the app normally**: The connection is still encrypted despite the warning

**üîß Debug Tools:**
- **`Test-Quick-Launch.cmd`** - Simple test launcher
- **`Create-Desktop-Shortcut.cmd`** - Manual shortcut creation
- **Check logs in terminal** - launcher shows detailed error messages

### üíæ **Windows Installer Troubleshooting** (Legacy)

#### **"Installer won't start or shows security warning"**
1. **Right-click** installer ‚Üí **"Run as administrator"**
2. **Windows Defender**: Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"
3. **Antivirus software**: Add exception for Financial-Command-Center-Launcher.exe
4. **Corporate networks**: Contact IT to whitelist the application

#### **"Python installation failed"**
1. **Check internet connection** - installer downloads Python packages
2. **Firewall settings** - ensure access to pypi.org
3. **Manual fix**: Install Python 3.8+ from python.org first
4. **Logs location**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Financial Command Center\Logs\launcher.log`

#### **"Desktop shortcut not created"**
1. **Check desktop permissions** - installer needs write access
2. **Manual creation**: Right-click installer ‚Üí "Send to" ‚Üí "Desktop (create shortcut)"
3. **Business networks**: IT policies may block shortcut creation

#### **"System tray icon missing"**
1. **Windows notification area**: Click "^" to expand hidden icons
2. **Notification settings**: Ensure "Financial Command Center" is enabled
3. **Restart application**: Exit and relaunch installer

**üìû Need Help?** Check `launcher.log` file in installation folder for detailed error information.
