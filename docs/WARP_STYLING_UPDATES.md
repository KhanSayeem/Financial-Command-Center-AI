- **Removed emojis** from JavaScript success/error messages
- **Cleaned up** all feature descriptions and section headers

### ✅ **Text Visibility Fixes**

### ✅ **Command Examples Reformatting**

  ```html
  <h4>Financial Health Check</h4>
  <p>"Show me our current financial health and system status"</p>
