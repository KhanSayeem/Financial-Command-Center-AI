- ✅ Eliminates "Not Secure" warnings automatically

**Commands Added:**
```bash
python cert_manager.py --mkcert         # Generate browser-trusted certificates
python cert_manager.py --install-ca     # Install CA to system trust store
```

### 2. **Enhanced Certificate Trust Store Integration**
- ✅ Automatic Windows certificate store integration
- ✅ PowerShell-based certificate installation
- ✅ Fallback to certutil.exe method
- ✅ Cross-platform trust store management

### 3. **Improved Certificate Chain Validation**
- ✅ Enhanced certificate generation with proper metadata
- ✅ Better Subject Alternative Names (SAN) handling
- ✅ Automatic certificate renewal detection
- ✅ Certificate health monitoring improvements

### 4. **Comprehensive Browser-Specific Instructions**
- ✅ Created `BROWSER_TRUST_GUIDE.md` with detailed instructions
- ✅ Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge specific procedures
- ✅ Mobile device certificate installation
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides for common issues

### 5. **Automated Installation Scripts**
- ✅ Windows batch script for certificate installation
- ✅ Unix shell script for macOS/Linux installation
- ✅ Client bundle generation with all necessary files
- ✅ Step-by-step installation wizards

### 6. **Testing and Verification Tools**
- ✅ Created `test_ssl_trust.py` for comprehensive testing
- ✅ SSL connection testing without verification disabled
- ✅ Certificate store validation
- ✅ curl command testing for system-level trust

## 🚀 New Features

### **Automatic Certificate Trust (mkcert)**
```bash
# One command to generate trusted certificates
python cert_manager.py --mkcert
# Result: Browsers show secure connection immediately
```

### **Smart Certificate Management**
- Prefers mkcert when available
- Falls back to self-signed + trust store installation
- Automatic CA installation to system store
- Cross-platform compatibility

### **Enhanced Health Monitoring**
```bash
python cert_manager.py --health
```
Now shows:
- mkcert availability
- Trust store installation status
- Platform information
- Certificate generation method used

### **Client Installation Bundle**
```bash
python cert_manager.py --bundle
```
Creates `certs/client_bundle/` with:
- `ca_certificate.crt` - The CA certificate
- `install_certificate_windows.bat` - Windows installer
- `install_certificate_unix.sh` - macOS/Linux installer
- `README.md` - Complete installation instructions

## 📋 Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `--mkcert` | Generate browser-trusted certificates with mkcert |
| `--install-ca` | Install CA certificate to system trust store |
